        Showing Tutorials, My reviews (as well as others), and sites that have
        helped me over the years, is TRUE goal I have with this section. The
        Linux related ideas I came up with to add to the main site started to
        get way out of hand to put in a "small section" so that's when I decided
        to do the split into TechHQ (former Windows Section ... and still has
        some cross-platform stuff) and LinuxHQ. This section has info on:

        <ul>
            <li>
                Linux Desktop options including screenshots, system requirments,
                and info on what version is in what Linux Distrobution
            </li>
            <li>
                Linux Distrobution information including currently supported
                release and desktop options and screenshots
            </li>
            <li>
                Theming: Information on Linux Themes, Icon and Cursor packs to
                custom the look of your Linux desktop
            </li>
        </ul>
    </div>
