theme idea 

for the (?? what do you call them .. the light-dark combo thing KP did in his video), rename them to "level-1" or "l1" etc etc

--------------------------------------------------------------
BODY COLORS ("white" vs "black"... not theme or accent related )
--------
BACKGROUND

dark theme - darkest level 1 and then gets lighter toward level 3
- this means level 1 (ex) should be say 600 ~> 500 ~> 400 


light theme - lightest level 1 and then gets darker (?? at least NOT lighter) toward level 3
- this means the level should 500= ~> 600= ~~> 700

----------------------------------------------------
FG/Text color 

Dark mode 
- I think maybe color at level 500 (normal/default)...do i even want to dim that... IF I DO maybe like level 2 and level 3 is like 600 (both)

light mode (granted dark is not pure black) - maybe keep it at 500 for all three levels ?
