I think my plan for astro_practice and homepage is this 

- do most of the edits and whatnot on astro_practice
- at certain points (? if i have this right) run "npm build dev"
- move those to "homepage" (what is on the web)
-- THIS WILL not load "Homepage" up with branches and different git commit histories
